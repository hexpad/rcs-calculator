this program uses the radar wavelength and shape dimensions to calculate radar cross section using standard formulas.

# Example

```cpp
Enter radar wavelength in meters: 0.03
Enter shape (sphere=1, flatplate=2, corner=3, cylinder=4): 1
Enter sphere radius (meters): 0.5

Calculated RCS: 0.785398 m^2
```
